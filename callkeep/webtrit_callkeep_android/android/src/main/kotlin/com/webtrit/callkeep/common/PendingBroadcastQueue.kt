/**
 * In-process queue for broadcasts that may fire before the target receiver is registered.
 *
 * Both sender and receiver must be in the same process. When a broadcast is sent to a
 * component that has not started yet, the sender posts an entry here. The receiver drains
 * the queue on startup and handles any pending entries as if the broadcast had just arrived.
 *
 * Keyed by an arbitrary string (e.g. "ACTION:callId"). Thread-safe. No TTL — entries persist
 * until consumed. Suitable for short-lived FGS-to-FGS communication within one app session.
