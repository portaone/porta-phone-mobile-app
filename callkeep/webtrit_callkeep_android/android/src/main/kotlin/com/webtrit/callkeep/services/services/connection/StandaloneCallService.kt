/**
 * Standalone call management service for devices that do not expose the
 * `android.software.telecom` system feature (e.g. some tablets, Android Go builds,
 * certain custom OEM configurations).
 *
 * On devices with Telecom support, [PhoneConnectionService] (a [android.telecom.ConnectionService])
 * handles call management through the Android Telecom framework. On devices without Telecom,
 * this service acts as an independent call manager — tracking call state, managing audio
 * routing directly via [AudioManager], and dispatching the same [ConnectionEvent] broadcasts
 * that [PhoneConnectionService] produces in the Telecom path. This means [ForegroundService]
 * and the Flutter layer do not need to be aware of which path is active.
 *
 * The service runs in the main process (no `android:process` in the manifest).
 * It is started as a foreground service on the first incoming call and stopped when all
 * calls have ended or a teardown command is received.
