/**
 * The complete per-call state of [MainProcessConnectionTracker], one immutable record per callId.
 *
 * Every lifecycle transition replaces the whole record in a single atomic
 * `ConcurrentHashMap.compute` step, so a reader always observes a consistent snapshot and never
 * a half-applied transition. The fields deliberately mirror the independent facts the tracker
 * has always kept — a call CAN be both registered and pending for a moment (a push-path
 * re-registration of a call the app already knows), so [metadata] and [pending] are separate
 * fields, not one exclusive phase.
 *
 * A record with every field at its default is observationally identical to an absent one
 * (all tracker queries return the same answers), so records are never removed individually —
 * they live until [MainProcessConnectionTracker.clear] wipes the session. This also preserves
 * the "ever seen" marker: [state] stays set for a terminated call, which the derived
 * [MainProcessConnectionTracker.isTerminated] and the cold-start adoption in
 * reportNewIncomingCall rely on.
 *
 * The class is internal to the core layer: only [MainProcessConnectionTracker] creates and
 * stores records (its `calls` map is private), everything else reads through the
 * [ConnectionTracker] query API.
