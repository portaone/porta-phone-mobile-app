/**
 * A lightweight shadow registry that mirrors [com.webtrit.callkeep.services.services.connection.PhoneConnectionService]
 * connection state in the main process.
 *
 * Updated from broadcasts emitted by [com.webtrit.callkeep.services.services.connection.PhoneConnectionService]:
 * - [com.webtrit.callkeep.services.broadcaster.CallLifecycleEvent.IncomingConnectionReported] -> promote incoming
 * - [com.webtrit.callkeep.services.broadcaster.CallLifecycleEvent.AnswerCall]           -> markAnswered
 * - [com.webtrit.callkeep.services.broadcaster.CallLifecycleEvent.HungUp] /
 *   [com.webtrit.callkeep.services.broadcaster.CallLifecycleEvent.DeclineCall]          -> markTerminated
 * - [com.webtrit.callkeep.services.broadcaster.CallLifecycleEvent.OngoingCall]          -> promote outgoing
 *
 * All per-call state lives in a single [CallRecord] per callId, and every transition is one
 * atomic [ConcurrentHashMap.compute] on that record: a reader always observes a consistent
 * record, never a half-applied transition, and different calls never block each other. The
 * record's fields deliberately mirror the independent facts the tracker has always kept —
 * a call CAN be both promoted and pending for a moment (a push-path re-registration of a call
 * the app already knows), so registration and pending are separate fields, not one exclusive
 * phase.
 *
 * Termination is derived: a call is considered terminated when its state was observed at least
 * once ([CallRecord.state] is set) and it is no longer registered, pending, answered, or
 * awaiting a deferred answer. No explicit terminated flag is maintained, so a call that
 * re-arrives with the same ID (e.g. transfer back) is never incorrectly blocked.
 *
 * This allows [ForegroundService] and [com.webtrit.callkeep.ConnectionsApi] to query connection
 * state without crossing a process boundary. The main process never reads
 * [com.webtrit.callkeep.services.services.connection.PhoneConnectionService.connectionManager]
 * directly — that object lives in the `:callkeep_core` JVM and is empty in the main process.
 * Call state is mirrored via a combination of main-process updates (pending registration and
 * local guards) and IPC broadcasts from `:callkeep_core` for lifecycle transitions.
