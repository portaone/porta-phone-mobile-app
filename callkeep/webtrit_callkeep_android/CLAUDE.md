## Role of this package

`webtrit_callkeep_android` is the **Android platform implementation** of the callkeep plugin. It
contains two layers:

- **Dart layer** (`lib/src/`) — `WebtritCallkeepAndroid` registers itself as the platform instance
  and proxies calls via Pigeon.
- **Kotlin layer** (`android/`) — Android services, Telecom integration, notification management.

## Commands

```bash
# From this directory
flutter pub get
flutter analyze lib test
dart format --line-length 80 --set-exit-if-changed lib test

# Pigeon regeneration (after editing pigeons/callkeep.messages.dart)
../tool/pigeon.sh   # runs pigeon and strips the trailing whitespace its Kotlin and Objective-C generators leave
```

## Critical rules

- Never edit `lib/src/common/callkeep.pigeon.dart` manually — regenerate via Pigeon.
- Never rename/remove Kotlin classes annotated `@Keep`.
- `PhoneConnectionService` runs in a **separate OS process** (`:callkeep_core`) — no shared
  in-memory state with main process. Use `CallkeepCore.instance` for all cross-process interactions.
- `CallMetadata` must NOT implement `Parcelable` — use `toBundle()` / `fromBundle()` instead.
- Background isolate entry points need `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`.
