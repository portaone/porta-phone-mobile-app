# AGENTS.md — webtrit_callkeep_android

Android platform implementation. Two layers: Dart (Flutter side) and Kotlin (native side).

> Detailed per-component architecture documentation lives in **[docs/](docs/)**.

## Dual-process architecture

The Android implementation runs in **two separate OS processes**:

| Process          | Key class                | Role                                                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Main app process | `ForegroundService`      | Hosts Flutter engine; Pigeon host API; bridges Telecom ↔ Flutter       |
| `:callkeep_core` | `PhoneConnectionService` | Android Telecom `ConnectionService`; manages `PhoneConnection` objects |

**IPC between processes**: app-scoped broadcasts (`sendBroadcast` with `setPackage`) via
`ConnectionServicePerformBroadcaster`, and explicit `startService` intents for commands.

`MainProcessConnectionTracker` is the main-process shadow of connection state, updated from
broadcasts sent by `:callkeep_core`. It is an internal implementation detail exposed through
`CallkeepCore`.

### CallkeepCore -- the single access point

**All code in the main process must interact with `PhoneConnectionService`
through `CallkeepCore.instance`, not `connectionManager` directly.**

- State reads: `CallkeepCore.instance.getAll()`, `.exists()`, `.getState()`, etc. -- backed by
  `MainProcessConnectionTracker`.
- Commands: `CallkeepCore.instance.startAnswerCall()`, `.tearDownService()`,
  `.sendTearDownConnections()`, etc. -- dispatched via explicit `startService` intents or app-scoped
  broadcasts.

**Never touch connection state via `connectionManager.*` from the main process.**
`PhoneConnectionService` runs in the `:callkeep_core` OS process -- the connections held by
`connectionManager` in the main JVM heap do not exist, so reading or mutating them there is a
silent no-op. ONE sanctioned exception: the `pendingCallIds` pre-registration, which
`checkAndReservePending` populates in the MAIN-process heap during `startIncomingCall` --
`InProcessCallkeepCore.clearAndMarkEndCallDispatched` must drop it from the main process, or a
transfer-back reusing the callId is rejected as a duplicate.

### IPC events

All cross-process communication uses app-scoped broadcasts (`sendBroadcast` with `setPackage`) and
explicit `startService` intents. Events are grouped by broadcaster:

**CallLifecycleEvent** (`:callkeep_core` -> Main):
`AnswerCall`, `DeclineCall`, `HungUp`, `OngoingCall`, `DidPushIncomingCall`, `OutgoingFailure`,
`IncomingFailure`, `ConnectionNotFound`

**CallMediaEvent** (`:callkeep_core` -> Main):
`AudioMuting`, `AudioDeviceSet`, `AudioDevicesUpdate`, `SentDTMF`, `ConnectionHolding`

**CallCommandEvent** (Main -> `:callkeep_core`, with one ack going the other way):

| Event                 | Direction                | Payload  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TearDownConnections` | Main -> `:callkeep_core` | --       | Trigger `hungUp()` + `cleanConnections()` on all PhoneConnections                                                                                        |
| `TearDownComplete`    | `:callkeep_core` -> Main | --       | Ack that tearDown completed                                                                                                                              |
| `ReserveAnswer`       | Main -> `:callkeep_core` | `callId` | Deferred answer reservation cross-process                                                                                                                |
| `CleanConnections`    | Main -> `:callkeep_core` | --       | Clear all connections without `hungUp()`                                                                                                                 |
| `ReplayAudioState`    | Main -> `:callkeep_core` | --       | Ask all PhoneConnections to re-emit audio device + mute state; used by `ForegroundService.onDelegateSet()` to restore Flutter audio UI after hot restart |

## Android services

| Service                  | Process          | Purpose                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `PhoneConnectionService` | `:callkeep_core` | Telecom integration; creates/destroys `PhoneConnection` |
| `ForegroundService`      | main             | Active call; Pigeon host; mute/hold/speaker/DTMF        |
| `IncomingCallService`    | main             | One-shot push-notification-triggered call handling      |
| `ActiveCallService`      | main             | Notification for multiple simultaneous calls            |

---

## Pigeon workflow

1. Edit `pigeons/callkeep.messages.dart`.
2. Run from this package directory:

   ```bash
   flutter pub run pigeon --input pigeons/callkeep.messages.dart
   ```

3. Commit both the input file and all generated output (`callkeep.pigeon.dart`, Kotlin files under
   `android/`).

**Never manually edit** `lib/src/common/callkeep.pigeon.dart` or Kotlin files under
`android/src/main/kotlin/…/api/`.

When adding a converter for a new Pigeon type, add an extension in `lib/src/common/converters.dart`.

---

## Background modes

### Push notification isolate (one-shot)

- Entry point: `AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundPushNotificationBootstrapService`
- Triggered by: FCM or another isolate calling `reportNewIncomingCall` on the bootstrap service
- Callback signature:
  `Future<void> onCallback(CallkeepPushNotificationSyncStatus, CallkeepIncomingCallMetadata?)`
- Service: `IncomingCallService`

The background isolate entry point function **must** be annotated `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`. The
isolate uses `CallkeepBackgroundServiceDelegate` (`performAnswerCall`, `performEndCall`) for
native → Dart events.

---

## SMS-triggered calls

- Android only; requires `RECEIVE_SMS` + `BROADCAST_SMS` permissions.
- Message prefix: `<#> WEBTRIT:` (hard-coded security filter, do not change).
- Regex pattern (4 capture groups in order): `callId`, `handle`, `displayName`, `hasVideo`.
- Configured via `initializeSmsReception(messagePrefix:, regexPattern:)`.
- Full regex spec: `docs/sms_trigger_regex_requirements.md` at repo root.

## Android-only APIs (accessed via platform interface)

| API                                                                    | Purpose                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `showOverLockscreen` / `wakeScreenOnShow`                              | Activity control for lock screen |
| `sendToBackground` / `isDeviceLocked`                                  | App window management            |
| `getFullScreenIntentPermissionStatus` / `openFullScreenIntentSettings` | Full-screen intent permissions   |
| `getBatteryMode`                                                       | Battery optimization status      |
| `requestPermissions` / `checkPermissionsStatus`                        | Runtime permission management    |
| `getDiagnosticReport`                                                  | Debug diagnostics map            |
| `getConnection` / `getConnections` / `cleanConnections`                | Connection state queries         |
| `playRingbackSound` / `stopRingbackSound`                              | Audio control                    |

## Integration tests

The public API is covered by integration tests in
`../webtrit_callkeep/example/integration_test/`. See the **Integration tests** section in
[README.md](README.md) for the full list of test files and what each covers.

## Key invariants

- Classes annotated `@Keep` in Kotlin **must not** be renamed or removed — they are referenced by
  ProGuard/R8 rules.
- All Pigeon host API implementations run on the platform thread; do not block.
- `PhoneConnectionService` runs in a separate process — it cannot share in-memory state with the
  main process; use IPC.
- **Never call `connectionManager.*` from the main process.** Use `CallkeepCore.instance` instead.
  `PhoneConnectionService` runs in a separate OS process -- any direct `connectionManager` access
  from the main process is a silent no-op.
- Never import Kotlin-layer constants or classes into the Dart layer directly; go through Pigeon.
