# CallkeepCore / InProcessCallkeepCore

**Files**:

- `kotlin/com/webtrit/callkeep/services/core/CallkeepCore.kt` (interface)
- `kotlin/com/webtrit/callkeep/services/core/InProcessCallkeepCore.kt` (implementation)
- `kotlin/com/webtrit/callkeep/services/core/CallServiceRouter.kt` (backend routing)

## Responsibility

`CallkeepCore` is the single facade used by the **main process** for all interactions with the
call backend. It combines three concerns:

1. **State queries and mutations** -- the shadow call state held in
   `MainProcessConnectionTracker` (see [connection-tracker.md](connection-tracker.md)).
2. **Command dispatch** -- commands routed through `CallServiceRouter` to either
   `PhoneConnectionService` (Telecom path, `:callkeep_core` process) or
   `StandaloneCallService` (no-Telecom path, main process). Call sites never know which backend
   is active.
3. **Event routing** -- receives `:callkeep_core` broadcasts via a single lazy internal receiver
   and fans them out to registered `ConnectionEventListener` subscribers; also supports direct
   in-process delivery (`notifyConnectionEvent`) for the standalone backend.

All main-process code that needs to know call state, trigger a call action, or subscribe to
connection events goes through `CallkeepCore.instance`.

## Access Pattern

```kotlin
val core = CallkeepCore.instance
core.startAnswerCall(metadata)
val meta = core.get(callId)
```

`InProcessCallkeepCore.instance` is a process-wide companion-object singleton, created eagerly on
first class access. The application context is read per call from `ContextHolder`, not at
construction time, so early singleton creation itself never throws. There is no `Application`
subclass: `ContextHolder.init` runs at each entry point (plugin attach, `WebtritCallkeep`,
service `onCreate`, receiver `onReceive`; the `:callkeep_core` services init their own copy), and
a CS command issued before any entry point has run throws `IllegalStateException` -- the
synchronous-throw case described under `startIncomingCall` below. Swapping the `instance`
assignment is the single point to change IPC strategy without touching call sites.

Known consumers: `ForegroundService`, `ConnectionsApi`, `WebtritCallkeepPlugin` (lock-screen
flags on ON_START), `BackgroundPushNotificationIsolateBootstrapApi`, `ExternalEngineCallApi`,
`IncomingCallService` + its handlers/controller, `ActiveCallService`,
`IncomingCallSmsTriggerReceiver`, `StandaloneCallService` (event delivery), `CallDiagnostics`.

## State Query API

Backed by `MainProcessConnectionTracker`; exact semantics (derived termination, guard behavior,
invariants) are documented in [connection-tracker.md](connection-tracker.md).

## State Mutation API

Mutations are driven mostly from `ForegroundService.onConnectionEvent` as broadcasts arrive from
the backend; the facade adds one composite:

| Method                                                         | Typical trigger                                                                                                                | Effect                                                                                                                              |

`clearAndMarkEndCallDispatched` is the one sanctioned main-process touch of
`PhoneConnectionService.connectionManager`: it drops the `pendingCallIds` reservation that
`checkAndReservePending` created in the MAIN-process heap, so a transfer-back with the same
callId is not rejected as a duplicate. The general "never call `connectionManager.*` from the
main process" rule concerns connection state, which exists only in the `:callkeep_core` heap --
see the note in [connection-tracker.md](connection-tracker.md).

(`updateMetadata` is a `ConnectionTracker` member, not part of this facade -- external callers
reach it via `startUpdateCall`.)

## Connection Event Listener API

`InProcessCallkeepCore` holds a single lazy `BroadcastReceiver` (`globalReceiver`) registered on
the first `addConnectionEventListener` call and unregistered when the last listener is removed
(ref-counted). Listeners receive events via `onConnectionEvent(event, data)` on the main thread.

| Method                               | Description                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `addConnectionEventListener(l)`      | Register a persistent global subscriber                                                                     |
| `removeConnectionEventListener(l)`   | Unregister; tears down globalReceiver when list is empty                                                    |
| `registerConnectionEvents(...)`      | Register a temporary per-call dynamic receiver                                                              |
| `unregisterConnectionEvents(...)`    | Unregister a temporary receiver                                                                             |
| `notifyConnectionEvent(event, data)` | Deliver an event directly to listeners and per-call receivers, bypassing ActivityManager broadcast dispatch |

**Global events** (routed to all `ConnectionEventListener` subscribers):
`IncomingConnectionReported`, `ReplayIncomingCall`, `ConnectionStateChanged`, `DeclineCall`,
`HungUp`, `ConnectionNotFound`, `AnswerCall`, `AudioDeviceSet`, `AudioDevicesUpdate`,
`AudioMuting`, `ConnectionHolding`, `SentDTMF`.

**Per-call dynamic receivers** (registered ad-hoc, not via listener):
`OngoingCall`, `OutgoingFailure` (both in `ForegroundService.startCall`), `TearDownComplete`
(tearDown ack).

**Delivery gap**: `IncomingFailure` is dispatched by `PhoneConnectionService`
(`onCreateIncomingConnectionFailed`) and is excluded from the global listener events, but no
main-process receiver currently registers for it -- the event is dropped. Incoming-failure
handling relies on the `HungUp`/`ConnectionNotFound` path instead.

`notifyConnectionEvent` exists for `StandaloneCallService`, which runs in the main process: on
certain OEM devices the system suppresses app-originated `sendBroadcast` calls entirely, so the
standalone backend delivers its lifecycle events as synchronous in-process calls into the same
handlers. Both backends therefore feed the same event pipeline and the same tracker mutations.

## Command Dispatch API

Commands go through `CallServiceRouter`, which picks the backend once at construction via
`TelephonyUtils.isTelecomSupported`. That asks the release before it asks the device: below
API 26 the answer is no whatever the hardware, because this plugin registers a **self-managed**
`PhoneAccount` and self-managed does not exist there - Telecom would accept the call and lose
it. From API 26 up, Telecom is considered supported when the `android.software.telecom` feature
flag is present, OR -- fallback for OEM builds that omit the flag despite having full Telecom --
when `TelephonyManager.phoneType != PHONE_TYPE_NONE`.

So `StandaloneCallService` (main process) takes devices with no telephony at all (Wi-Fi-only
tablets, Android Go builds) **and** every release below API 26; everything else uses
`PhoneConnectionService` (startService intents into `:callkeep_core`).

### Call Setup

| Method                                        | Description                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `startIncomingCall(meta, onSuccess, onError)` | Reserve pending + trigger incoming registration |
| `startOutgoingCall(meta)`                     | Trigger outgoing connection creation            |

`startIncomingCall` owns the `pendingCallIds` reservation: it calls `addPending` first and rejects
a concurrent duplicate registration (push isolate vs foreground signaling for the same callId)
with `CALL_ID_ALREADY_EXISTS` if the entry already exists. On any failure -- logical `onError` or a
synchronous throw from the backend -- it drains the reservation exactly once before propagating.
Synchronous throws bypass `onError` and reach Dart as a Pigeon channel-error; callers that
pre-register state must clean it themselves or rely on their own timeout safety-net
(`ForegroundService.reportNewIncomingCall` does the latter).

### In-Call Control

`startAnswerCall`, `startDeclineCall`, `startHungUpCall`, `startEstablishCall`,
`startUpdateCall` (also merges metadata into the tracker), `startSendDtmfCall`,
`startMutingCall`, `startHoldingCall`, `startSpeaker`, `setAudioDevice` -- all take
`CallMetadata` and are routed to the active backend.

### Call Grouping

`startSetCallGroup(groupId, callIds)` and `startUnsetCallGroup(callIds)` are the exception to
the paragraph above, twice over. They take a list of call ids rather than `CallMetadata`,
because the membership of a group is not a property of any one call; and they answer with a
`CallGroupOutcome` rather than nothing: `ACCEPTED`, `NOT_SUPPORTED` when no backend took the
request, `LIMIT_REACHED` when another group is live under another name (every backend holds
one group at a time). `ForegroundService` turns that into the pigeon answer. The core is also
where the declared membership is kept: on `ACCEPTED` it records the group on each call in
`MainProcessConnectionTracker`, `startUnsetCallGroup` releases the calls, `markTerminated`
takes an ended call out and dissolves a group left with one member, and `clear()` empties it
with the session. `isGrouped(callId)` and `groupMembersWith(callId)` read it. The core keeps
its global receiver registered from the first call it learns about, not only while a listener
is attached, and while no `CallEndListener` is attached it marks a call terminated itself on
`HungUp`, `DeclineCall` and `ConnectionNotFound`: a member that ends while the activity's bridge
is away still leaves its group, and the next bridge finds the record as the calls left it. The
foreground service is the one `CallEndListener`: while it is attached it handles the end with
its full context and the core stays out of its way. A listener that only observes - the
incoming-call service handles `AnswerCall` and nothing else - does not count, so its presence
while the bridge is away changes nothing. Both backends
take the request today, and both keep the membership themselves; the Telecom backend does not
declare it to Telecom (see [phone-connection-service.md](phone-connection-service.md)).
Grouping only changes how the OS presents calls that run either way, so a refusal is never a
reason to end one.

| `replayAudioState()`        | One-way pull: re-emit audio state (device + mute) to a fresh delegate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `replayConnectionStates()`  | One-way pull seeding a freshly attached delegate / restarted main process (cold-start race). For every live connection re-emits `ConnectionStateChanged` (live states only; restores e.g. STATE_ACTIVE for the already-answered adoption), then `AnswerCall` (callId-only metadata) for answered connections, or `ReplayIncomingCall` (full metadata) for still-ringing ones -- the ONLY path by which a fresh delegate learns of a still-ringing call |
