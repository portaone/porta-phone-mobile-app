# Background Services

Two foreground services operate in the **main process** to handle calls that arrive while the
Flutter app is backgrounded or killed.

---

## IncomingCallService

**File**: `kotlin/com/webtrit/callkeep/services/services/incoming_call/IncomingCallService.kt`

**Annotation**: `@Keep`

**Implements**: `ConnectionEventListener`

**Type**: One-shot foreground service (`foregroundServiceType=phoneCall`)

### Responsibility

Spawned when an FCM push notification (or SMS trigger) announces an incoming call. It:

1. Starts a short-lived Flutter background isolate.
2. Shows the incoming-call notification / system UI.
3. Waits for the user or app code to answer or decline.
4. Exits when the call is answered, declined, or timed out.

### Lifecycle

- Started by `NotificationManager.showIncomingCallNotification()`, whose only caller is
  `PhoneConnection.onShowIncomingCallUi()` in the `:callkeep_core` process. (The push path
  gets there indirectly: `reportNewIncomingCall()` hands the call to
  `CallkeepCore.registerIncomingCall()`, Telecom registers it, and this service starts from the
  resulting connection callback.)
- `onCreate()` - registers the internal release receiver (see below), subscribes to
  `CallkeepCore` events via `addConnectionEventListener(this)`, and wires the handlers.
  It does **not** promote to foreground yet.
- `onStartCommand(IC_INITIALIZE)` - delegates to `IncomingCallHandler`, which shows the
  ringing notification and promotes the service to foreground (per-call notification id,
  1000+). The call itself was already registered with Telecom by `PhoneConnectionService`
  before this service started. Every `onStartCommand` path returns `START_NOT_STICKY`: if
  the OS kills the service, a restart with a null intent must not re-post a notification
  for a call that is gone.
- The notification's Answer and Decline buttons also enter through `onStartCommand`, as
  service `PendingIntent`s (`NotificationAction.Answer` / `Decline`); Answer additionally
  drops the notification buttons right away.
- Release (the end of the ringing phase) is delivered via an **internal broadcast**
  (`IC_RELEASE_HANDED_OVER` / `IC_RELEASE_ENDED`), not via `onStartCommand`: the
  receiver only lives while the service is alive, so a release arriving after the service
  stopped goes nowhere instead of restarting it.
- Every release names its call (`callId` extra), and the service acts only on a release for
  the call it shows. The release is sent on the end of any call - an outgoing or active one,
  or a second incoming call Telecom refused while this one rings - so acting on another
  call's release would tear down a call that is still ringing. A release can also come before
  the service knows its call: one posted while the service is not running waits in
  `PendingBroadcastQueue` under its call id, and one received before `IC_INITIALIZE` is kept
  by the service per call id. `handleLaunch` acts only on the release for the call it
  launches. An `AnswerCall` event is ignored only once the service shows another call.
- The push isolate ends and hands off calls by id (`releaseCall`, `handoffCall`), and its
  session can know more than one call. `CallLifecycleHandler` stops the service only when
  that id is the call the service shows; for another call it ends that call and keeps running.
- Two safety-net timeouts force-stop the service if the normal flow stalls: an independent
  60 s timeout armed at launch, and a 2 s stop timeout armed when the release arrives.
- `onDestroy()` - unsubscribes, stops foreground, and explicitly cancels the current
  notification (on some Samsung builds `stopForeground(REMOVE)` alone leaves it in the
  shade), then tears the isolate down.

### Answered-call notification handoff

Once the call is answered (from the notification button, the system call UI, a headset or a
watch) the ringing notification is replaced in place by its **silent form** - same call, no
buttons - so the user is not offered Answer for a call already taken while the app finishes
starting. When `ActiveCallService` posts the in-progress notification, it broadcasts
`IC_ACTIVE_CALL_VISIBLE`; on receiving it, `IncomingCallService` gives its own notification
up (`stopForeground`) so the shade does not describe the same call twice. The service itself
keeps running - no longer foreground - until the connection is handed over to the app or a
safety-net timeout stops it.

### Connection Event Listener

`IncomingCallService` implements `ConnectionEventListener` and receives events routed by
`CallkeepCore`. It only acts on `AnswerCall` - when the system UI or the user answers,
`PhoneConnectionService` fires `AnswerCall`, which drops the notification buttons and forwards
to `CallLifecycleHandler.performAnswerCall()`. `DeclineCall` and `HungUp` are handled via the
`IC_RELEASE_ENDED` broadcast path instead to avoid a double `performEndCall` race.

## ActiveCallService

**File**: `kotlin/com/webtrit/callkeep/services/services/active_call/ActiveCallService.kt`

**Annotation**: `@Keep`

**Type**: Foreground service (`foregroundServiceType=phoneCall|microphone|camera`)

### Responsibility

Owns the single **active call notification** summarizing every call in progress (one
notification, `ActiveCallNotificationBuilder.NOTIFICATION_ID = 1`). It renders whatever
call list it is started with; the list itself lives in `NotificationManager`'s static
`activeCalls` state in the `:callkeep_core` process (see notifications.md), and this
service only ever sees the copy serialized into each start intent.

### Lifecycle

- Started (and re-started on every change) by `NotificationManager.upsertActiveCallsService()`
  whenever a call is added, removed or reordered: the service receives the full call list in
  the `metadata` intent extra and re-posts the notification.
- Stopped by `NotificationManager` (`context.stopService`) when the call list becomes empty,
  or by `NotificationManager.tearDown()`. The service stops itself only in the empty-restart
  guard (see below); on every other path it is stopped from outside.
- `onStartCommand` promotes to foreground with a type set computed per start: `phoneCall`
  always; `microphone` whenever the permission is granted (deliberately not conditioned on
  audio state - some OEM builds block microphone access with the screen off if the type is
  missing); `camera` when a video call is present and the permission is granted. On
  Android 14+ a background promotion (the sticky restart) rejects the `microphone` type with
  `SecurityException`; the service falls back to the plain `phoneCall` type so the restart
  does not crash-loop.
- After posting the notification it broadcasts `IC_ACTIVE_CALL_VISIBLE` so
  `IncomingCallService` can give up its now-redundant notification (see above).
- Returns `START_STICKY` for starts carrying calls (if the process is killed mid-call, the
  OS restarts the service); the Decline action and the empty-restart guard return
  `START_NOT_STICKY`.

### Notification action

The notification offers one Hang up button. Its intent carries the first call's bundle in
the extras. The service hangs up the first call of its in-memory list via
`CallkeepCore.startHungUpCall(call)`; when that list is empty (a fresh instance created by
the tap after a process death), it falls back to the call bundle from the intent extras.
With neither - Hang up tapped on a notification re-posted by a null-intent restart - it
tears down the connection services, removes the notification and stops itself.

### Sticky restart with a null intent

A `START_STICKY` restart after a main-process kill delivers a **null intent**, so the
restarted instance builds an empty call list. The restart bypasses `NotificationManager`
(whose call list lives in `:callkeep_core` and died with it), so nothing external would
ever stop such an instance - historically its half-empty ongoing notification could only
be removed by force-stopping the app. `onStartCommand` guards against this: after
satisfying the `startForeground` contract it detects the empty list, logs a warning,
tears down the connection services (a call leg may have survived in `:callkeep_core`,
and this restart is the last signal the main process gets about it), removes the
notification and stops itself with `stopSelf(startId)`, returning `START_NOT_STICKY`.
The teardown runs before `stopForeground` so the command toward the connection services
is still exempt from background-start restrictions; `stopSelf(startId)` (not a blanket
`stopSelf()`) keeps a queued metadata start from the recovering app alive.
