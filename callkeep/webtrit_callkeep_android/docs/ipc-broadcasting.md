# IPC Broadcasting

**File**: `kotlin/com/webtrit/callkeep/services/broadcaster/ConnectionServicePerformBroadcaster.kt`

## Overview

`ConnectionServicePerformBroadcaster` is the **cross-process event bus** between `:callkeep_core`
and the main process. It uses **app-scoped local broadcasts** (the intent's package is set to the
app package name) so no third-party app can receive or inject events.

All broadcasts use a single action string:

```text
com.webtrit.callkeep.CONNECTION_SERVICE_PERFORM
```

The event type is carried as a string extra inside the intent.

## Event Catalogue

### Call Lifecycle Events (`:callkeep_core` -> main)

| Event                        | Payload                                                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IncomingConnectionReported` | `callId`, `CallMetadata` bundle                             | Incoming `PhoneConnection` created -> register in the shadow state (register-only; the delegate is notified via signaling or `ReplayIncomingCall`)                                                     |
| `ReplayIncomingCall`         | `callId`, `CallMetadata` bundle                             | Re-deliver a still-ringing incoming call to a freshly attached delegate (sole foreground delivery; from the connection-state replay on delegate attach)                                                |
| `AnswerCall`                 | `callId`                                                    | Answer signal (guard); the ACTIVE state arrives separately via `ConnectionStateChanged`                                                                                                                |
| `ConnectionStateChanged`     | `callId`, `CallMetadata` bundle (carries `connectionState`) | Authoritative live connection state to mirror into the shadow state (RINGING/DIALING/ACTIVE/HOLDING). Terminal DISCONNECTED is NOT sent here -- it stays on the cause-carrying `HungUp`/`DeclineCall`. |
| `DeclineCall`                | `callId`                                                    | User rejected the call                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `HungUp`                     | `callId`, disconnect cause                                  | Call disconnected from either side                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `OngoingCall`                | `callId`, `CallMetadata` bundle                             | Outgoing connection dialing                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `OutgoingFailure`            | `callId`, failure info                                      | Outgoing call could not be created                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `IncomingFailure`            | `callId`, failure info                                      | Incoming call setup failed                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `ConnectionNotFound`         | `callId`                                                    | `PhoneConnection` not found — synthesized HungUp                                                                                                                                                       |

### Call Media Events (`:callkeep_core` -> main)

| Event                | Payload                       | Meaning                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `AudioMuting`        | `callId`, `muted: Boolean`    | Mute state changed                  |
| `AudioDeviceSet`     | `callId`, `AudioDevice`       | Active audio device changed         |
| `AudioDevicesUpdate` | `callId`, `List<AudioDevice>` | Available audio device list changed |
| `SentDTMF`           | `callId`, digit               | DTMF tone dispatched                |
| `ConnectionHolding`  | `callId`, `onHold: Boolean`   | Hold state changed                  |

### Service Command Ack Events (`:callkeep_core` -> main)

| Event              | Payload | Meaning                                        |
|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| `TearDownComplete` | —       | All connections torn down; tearDown can finish |

### Pending Registration Commands (main -> `:callkeep_core`, via explicit intent)

| `ServiceAction` | Description                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NotifyPending` | Register callId + metadata before Telecom fires `onCreateIncomingConnection` |

Note: Most main -> `:callkeep_core` commands are `startService` intents, not broadcasts. The
`NotifyPending` action is the only one also used as a direct intent to `PhoneConnectionService`.

## Broadcast Transport

```text
Sender:
    val intent = Intent(ACTION_CONNECTION_SERVICE_PERFORM)
        .setPackage(context.packageName)
        .putExtra(EXTRA_EVENT_TYPE, event.name)
        .putExtras(payload)
    context.sendBroadcast(intent)

Receiver:
    val filter = IntentFilter(ACTION_CONNECTION_SERVICE_PERFORM)
    context.registerReceiverCompat(receiver, filter)
```

`registerReceiverCompat` is a helper that calls `registerReceiver(receiver, filter,
RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED)` on API 33+ and the equivalent on older versions.

## Sender Locations

| Event                             | Sender                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All call lifecycle / media events | `PhoneConnection` (via `performEventHandle()` in `PhoneConnectionService`) |
| `TearDownComplete`                | `PhoneConnectionService.onStartCommand` after tear-down                    |
| `TearDownConnections` (command)   | `ForegroundService` via `CallkeepCore.sendTearDownConnections()`           |

## Receiver Locations

| Receiver                                              | Listens For                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `InProcessCallkeepCore.globalReceiver`                | All global call lifecycle and media events; fans out to `ConnectionEventListener` subs |
| `ForegroundService` (via `ConnectionEventListener`)   | Global events routed by `CallkeepCore`                                                 |
| `IncomingCallService` (via `ConnectionEventListener`) | Global events routed by `CallkeepCore`                                                 |
| Per-call dynamic receivers in `ForegroundService`     | `OngoingCall`, `OutgoingFailure`, `IncomingFailure`, `TearDownComplete`                |
| `PhoneConnectionService` broadcast receiver           | `NotifyPending` (only during setup)                                                    |

`InProcessCallkeepCore` maintains a single `globalReceiver` registered via
`ConnectionServicePerformBroadcaster`. Individual services no longer register their own receivers
for `:callkeep_core` events — they subscribe through `CallkeepCore.addConnectionEventListener()`.
