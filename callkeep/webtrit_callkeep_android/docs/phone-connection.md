# PhoneConnection

**File**: `kotlin/com/webtrit/callkeep/services/services/connection/PhoneConnection.kt`

**Extends**: Android `Connection`

**Process**: `:callkeep_core`

## Responsibility

`PhoneConnection` represents a **single active call** inside Android Telecom. One instance exists
per call and is owned by `ConnectionManager`. It handles all Telecom-driven callbacks for that
call and dispatches corresponding events to the main process.

## State

| Field            | Type           | Description                                       |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `callId`         | `String`       | Unique call identifier (matches across processes) |
| `metadata`       | `CallMetadata` | Call details (display name, handle, flags)        |
| `hasAnswered`    | `Boolean`      | Whether the user has accepted the call            |
| `isMute`         | `Boolean`      | Current mute state                                |
| `hasVideo`       | `Boolean`      | Whether video is enabled                          |
| Internal `state` | `Int`          | Telecom connection state constant                 |

## Telecom Callback Methods

### `onShowIncomingCallUi()`

Telecom asks the app to display its incoming call UI.

- Acquires wake lock.
- Starts ringtone.
- Shows incoming call notification (via `NotificationManager`).

### `onAnswer(videoState)`

User or app code answers the call.

- Sets state to `STATE_ACTIVE`.
- Stops ringtone, cancels incoming-call notification.
- Dispatches `AnswerCall` broadcast to main process.

### `onReject()` / `onReject(rejectWithMessage, textMessage)`

User or app code declines the call.

- Sets state to `STATE_DISCONNECTED` with cause `CAUSE_REMOTE_USER_HANGUP` (rejected).
- Dispatches `DeclineCall` broadcast to main process.
- Calls `destroy()`.

### `onDisconnect()`

Called by Telecom when the call ends (hang-up from either side).

- Stops ringtone, audio, cancels notifications.
- Sets state to `STATE_DISCONNECTED`.
- Dispatches `HungUp` broadcast to main process.
- Calls `destroy()`.

### `onHold()` / `onUnhold()`

- Updates state to `STATE_HOLDING` / `STATE_ACTIVE`.
- Dispatches `ConnectionHolding` broadcast with new hold state.
- **Member of a call group** (`isGrouped`): complies with Telecom (`setOnHold()` / `setActive()`)
  but dispatches nothing. Telecom holds one call whenever another becomes active; the application
  owns the media of a group and a member is never held on its own, so the application is not told.
  The reply is not optional - a connection that does not reach the state Telecom asked for is
  disconnected a few seconds later. Leaving the group changes nothing about the state: the call
  stays as Telecom left it and holds reach the application again from the next one on.

### `onPlayDtmfTone(c)` / `onStopDtmfTone()`

- Dispatches `SentDTMF` broadcast.

### `onStateChanged(state)`

Telecom-driven hook fired on every connection state transition.

- Maps the raw Telecom `state` int via `telecomConnectionState(state)`.
- On `STATE_DISCONNECTED`, a member leaves its call group, which is taken apart once fewer than
  two calls remain in it.
- For live states (RINGING/DIALING/ACTIVE/HOLDING) dispatches `ConnectionStateChanged`,
  carrying the state in `CallMetadata.connectionState` so the main process MIRRORS it into the
  shadow state rather than inferring a fixed state per event type.
- Terminal DISCONNECTED is skipped here -- it stays on the cause-carrying `HungUp` / `DeclineCall`
  dispatched from `onDisconnect()` / `onReject()`.

### `onCallEndpointChanged(endpoint)` (API 34+) / legacy audio device change

Telecom addresses these to the foreground call. Grouped calls are ordinary connections to it -
there is no conference object to address instead - so each one hears them under its own call id.

- Dispatches `AudioDeviceSet` broadcast with the new endpoint.
- Dispatches `AudioDevicesUpdate` broadcast with full device list.

## Media Methods

### `changeMuteState(muted)`

- Updates `isMute`.
- Sets Telecom audio mute.
- Dispatches `AudioMuting` broadcast.

### `setSpeaker(on)` / `setAudioDevice(device)`

- Routes audio via the Telecom `CallAudioState` or `CallEndpoint` APIs.
- Dispatches `AudioDeviceSet` broadcast.

## Factory Methods

```kotlin
companion object {
    fun createIncomingPhoneConnection(context, callId, metadata): PhoneConnection
    fun createOutgoingPhoneConnection(context, callId, metadata): PhoneConnection
}
```text

Incoming connections start in `STATE_RINGING`; outgoing connections start in `STATE_DIALING`.

## Lifecycle Summary

```text
Incoming: INITIALIZING -> RINGING -> (onAnswer) ACTIVE -> (onDisconnect) DISCONNECTED
                                  -> (onReject)  DISCONNECTED
Outgoing: DIALING -> (setActive) ACTIVE -> (onDisconnect) DISCONNECTED
```

## Shared state

`PhoneConnection` owns the backend-independent `CallConnection`; metadata, answer and mute
state live there. Framework state stays on Android `Connection`. See
[Shared call connection and group](call-connection.md) for the ownership and hold boundary.
