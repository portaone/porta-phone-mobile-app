# webtrit_callkeep_platform_interface

The common platform interface for the `webtrit_callkeep` federated plugin. Defines the abstract
API contract, all shared data models, and delegate interfaces that every platform implementation
must satisfy.

---

## Purpose

This package exists so that:

- Platform implementations (`webtrit_callkeep_android`, `webtrit_callkeep_ios`) implement a
  consistent interface without depending on each other.
- The aggregator package (`webtrit_callkeep`) programs against a single abstract type.
- Third-party platform implementations can extend `WebtritCallkeepPlatform` without forking the
  plugin.

## Key types

### `CallkeepHandle`

```dart
CallkeepHandle.number('+15551234567')
CallkeepHandle.sip('user@example.com')
```

### `CallkeepDelegate`

| Callback | When it fires |
| --- | --- |
| `didPushIncomingCall` | Platform registered the incoming call (or reports an error) |
| `performAnswerCall` | User answered from system UI |
| `performEndCall` | User ended from system UI or system terminated the call |
| `performStartCall` | User initiated outgoing call from system UI |
| `continueStartCallIntent` | System confirmed outgoing call intent (iOS only) |
| `performSetHeld` | Hold toggled from system UI |
| `performSetMuted` | Mute toggled from system UI |
| `performSendDTMF` | DTMF sent from system dial pad |
| `performAudioDeviceSet` | Audio routing changed to a given device |
| `performAudioDevicesUpdate` | The set of available audio devices changed |
| `performSetCallGroup` | The OS grouped this call with another from its own call UI, or ungrouped it when the second is null; the application's own `setCallGroup` is applied by the plugin |
| `didActivateAudioSession` | System activated the audio session |
| `didDeactivateAudioSession` | System deactivated the audio session |
| `didReset` | System reset all call state (iOS only) |

`perform*` methods return `Future<bool>`. Return `false` to signal failure — the platform
terminates the call.

### `CallkeepEndCallReason`

`failed`, `remoteEnded`, `unanswered`, `answeredElsewhere`, `declinedElsewhere`, `missed`

### `CallkeepConnection`

Snapshot of a single call's state (Android only). Contains `callId`, `state`
(`CallkeepConnectionState`), and `metadata`.

## Implementing a new platform

```dart
class WebtritCallkeepCustom extends WebtritCallkeepPlatform {
  static void registerWith() {
    WebtritCallkeepPlatform.instance = WebtritCallkeepCustom();
  }
  // override all abstract methods
}
```
