# AGENTS.md — Webtrit CallKeep

Central reference for build commands, code standards, and architecture.
All Claude/AI agents working in this repo must follow these rules.

---

## Commands

### Install dependencies (all packages)

```bash
flutter pub global activate very_good_cli
very_good packages get --recursive
```

### Format (run inside a package directory)

```bash
dart format --line-length 120 --set-exit-if-changed lib
```

### Analyze

```bash
flutter analyze
```

### Test

```bash
very_good test -j 4 --optimization --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

### Run a single test file

```bash
flutter test test/path/to/test_file.dart
```

### Pigeon code generation

Run from `webtrit_callkeep_android/` or `webtrit_callkeep_ios/` after modifying the pigeon input:

```bash
../tool/pigeon.sh   # runs pigeon and strips the trailing whitespace its Kotlin and Objective-C generators leave
```

Generated files (`*.pigeon.dart`, Kotlin/Swift output) must be committed together with the input change.

## Code style

- **Quotes**: single quotes everywhere.
- **Line length**: 120 characters (`formatter: page_width: 120` in all `analysis_options.yaml`).
- **Trailing commas**: required on multi-line argument lists and collection literals.
- **Import order** (four groups, alphabetical within each, blank line between groups):
  1. `dart:` SDK imports
  2. `package:flutter/` imports
  3. Third-party `package:` imports
  4. Relative imports
- **Generated files**: never manually edit `*.g.dart`, `*.pigeon.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`. Regenerate via Pigeon or build_runner.
- **Linter**: `very_good_analysis` is active in all packages — fix warnings before committing.

## Architecture overview

This is a Flutter **federated plugin** (mono-repo):

```text
webtrit_callkeep/                    # Aggregator — no logic, delegates to platform packages
webtrit_callkeep_platform_interface/ # Shared abstract API, models, delegates
webtrit_callkeep_android/            # Android impl (Flutter Dart + Kotlin)
webtrit_callkeep_ios/                # iOS impl (Flutter Dart + Swift)
webtrit_callkeep_linux|macos|web|windows/  # Stubs (no-op implementations)
```

### Data flow

```text
Flutter app
    │  setDelegate(CallkeepDelegate)
    │  reportNewIncomingCall / startCall / endCall / ...
    ▼
Callkeep (singleton, webtrit_callkeep)
    │
    ▼
WebtritCallkeepPlatform (platform_interface)
    │
    ├── WebtritCallkeepAndroid  →  Pigeon  →  Kotlin services
    └── WebtritCallkeepIOS      →  Pigeon  →  Objective-C/CallKit
```

**Flutter to Platform**: `reportNewIncomingCall`, `startCall`, `answerCall`, `endCall`, `setHeld`, `setMuted`,
`setSpeaker`, `sendDTMF`, `setAudioDevice`, `setCallGroup`, `unsetCallGroup`.

**Platform to Flutter** (via `CallkeepDelegate`): `performStartCall`, `performAnswerCall`, `performEndCall`,
`performSetHeld`, `performSetMuted`, `performSendDTMF`, `performAudioDeviceSet`, `performAudioDevicesUpdate`,
`performSetCallGroup`, `didActivateAudioSession`, `didDeactivateAudioSession`, `didPushIncomingCall`.

`setCallGroup` names the group and takes its whole membership, not a change to it; a second
name while one group is live is refused with `maximumCallGroupsReached`;
`unsetCallGroup` names the calls that leave it; both speak only about how the operating system
presents the calls. The vocabulary stays on
that side of the fence deliberately: a group of calls belongs to Telecom and CallKit, whereas a
conference - a room, its participants, who is mixing the audio - belongs to the application.
Nothing in this surface names one, and nothing should.

`didReset` and `continueStartCallIntent` are declared on `CallkeepDelegate` but are delivered by iOS only:
the Android side has no source for either event, so they are absent from the Android pigeon surface.

`perform*` methods return `Future<bool>` — return `true` on success, `false` on failure.
Returning `false` causes the native side to abort the operation.

### Background isolates (Android only)

Two mutually exclusive modes:

| Mode              | Service               | Use case                                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Push notification | `IncomingCallService` | App uses FCM; one-shot isolate per push                      |
| Signaling         | `SignalingService`    | Persistent connection; isolate lives with foreground service |

Background isolate entry points **must** be annotated `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`.

## Key invariants

- **Do not** manually edit Pigeon-generated files. Change `pigeons/callkeep.messages.dart` and regenerate.
- **Do not** remove or rename Kotlin/Java classes annotated with `@Keep` — they are exempt from ProGuard/R8
  shrinking.
- The `Callkeep` class is a **singleton** — never instantiate it directly; use `Callkeep()`.
- Platform-specific APIs (Android battery mode, SMS reception, activity control) are accessed only through
  the platform interface, not imported directly from a platform package.
